On a player's first turn, if their guess is\n"," * within 10 of the number, return \"WARM!\"\n"," * further than 10 away from the number, return \"COLD!\"\n","3. On all subsequent turns, if a guess is \n"," * closer to the number than the previous guess return \"WARMER!\"\n"," * farther from the number than the previous guess, return \"COLDER!\"\n","4.
